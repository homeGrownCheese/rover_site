# Rover Photo Viewer

### This project is under development


This is a simple photo viewer for the nasa rover photos api. It is built with Django.

This project currently uses my own free NASA API key as a demo.  It is intended to be used as a tool to easily view the NASA rover pictures from their API.  Add your own API key to a local .env file.  You can get your own key at https://api.nasa.gov/.
